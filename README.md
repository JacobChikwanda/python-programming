# Python Basics Outline for OOP Class

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Programming
- *Class Objective*: Understand basic programming concepts.
- *Topics*:
  - What is programming?
  - Python installation & setup.
  - Writing your first Python program: "Hello, World!"
  - Basic syntax: variables, data types (integers, strings, floats, booleans).
  - Printing output.

## Lesson 2: Control Structures
- *Class Objective*: Learn how to control the flow of a program.
- *Topics*:
  - Conditional statements (if, else, elif).
  - Logical operators (and, or, not).
  - Loops: for and while.
  - Practice: Writing a simple program with conditions and loops.

## Lesson 3: Functions and Code Organization
- *Class Objective*: Understand how to organize code into reusable blocks.
- *Topics*:
  - Defining functions (def).
  - Function parameters and return values.
  - Practice: Write a function to calculate basic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).
  - Scope of variables (local vs global).

## Lesson 4: Lists and Dictionaries
- *Class Objective*: Learn how to work with collections of data.
- *Topics*:
  - Lists: creating, modifying, and accessing elements.
  - Dictionaries: key-value pairs, accessing values.
  - Iterating through lists and dictionaries.
  - Practice: Program to store and manage simple data (e.g., a contact list).

## Lesson 5: Basic File Handling
- *Class Objective*: Learn how to read from and write to files.
- *Topics*:
  - Opening files: open(), reading, writing, and closing files.
  - Exception handling with try, except.
  - Practice: Writing a program that saves data to a file and reads from it.

## Lesson 6: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- *Class Objective*: Transition into the basics of OOP.
- *Topics*:
  - What is OOP?
  - Classes and objects.
  - Defining a simple class with attributes and methods.
  - Practice: Create a basic class (e.g., a Car class with attributes like make and methods like start()).

## Lesson 7: Wrap-Up and Mini Project
- *Class Objective*: Reinforce learning with a project.
- *Topics*:
  - Combine the previous concepts to create a small project (e.g., a simple shopping cart or inventory management system).
  - Focus on applying control structures, functions, and basic OOP concepts.
